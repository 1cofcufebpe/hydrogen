## Gameplay
 
Tomb Raider (2013) is a third-person action-adventure game that combines exploration, combat, stealth, and platforming elements. The game features an open world environment that allows Lara to traverse various locations on the island, such as forests, caves, tombs, villages, and shanty towns. Lara can use various tools and weapons to interact with the environment and fight enemies, such as a bow, a pistol, a shotgun, a rifle, a climbing axe, and a rope. Lara can also use her survival instincts to highlight objects of interest, such as enemies, collectibles, resources, and puzzles.
 
The game also features a skill system that allows Lara to upgrade her abilities and unlock new moves by spending skill points earned from completing missions, finding secrets, and killing enemies. The skills are divided into three categories: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler. Survivor skills enhance Lara's survival instincts, resource gathering, and exploration abilities. Hunter skills improve Lara's combat proficiency with various weapons and stealth techniques. Brawler skills boost Lara's melee capabilities and durability in close quarters combat.
 
In addition to the main story missions, the game also offers optional side quests and challenges that reward Lara with extra experience points, salvage (the game's currency), and relics (collectible items that reveal more about the island's history and culture). The game also features a multiplayer mode that pits two teams of players against each other in various modes and maps inspired by the single-player campaign.
